Modern libraries like pytorch and tensorflow use a standard practice called \"im2col\" where the entire image is stretched into a single vector arranged by the filter size. One way is to then also dilate our filter adding zeros in between such that a single matrix multiplication will simulate the filter being slid over the image. \n",

This results in matmul between a 1x27 image and 27x1 kernel, resulting in a single scalar value.

We need special type of matrix flatenning such that all pixels of local receptive fields(3x3x3 = 27) are in one dimension(x, 27) and all such local receptive fields(30x30 = 900) are in another, batch dimension(900, x) which represents the number of such possible receptive fields. This corresponds to number of pixels in activation map. Finally we need to consider all the receptive fields of all images in the batch. This doesnot create new dimension (not, eg. 16x900x27), but we stack all the receptive fields of all the images vertically. (i.e 900x16 = 14,400).
