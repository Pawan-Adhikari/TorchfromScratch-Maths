# TorchfromScratch-Maths

This repository contains code, notebooks, and resources for understanding and implementing core mathematical concepts in Deep Learning. It is basically a custom Deep Learning Framework similar to pytorch, but on CPU. It is organized into modules covering traditional machine learning, perceptrons, autograd, MLPs, tensors, CNNs, transformers, and deployment tests.

## Structure
- **00_Traditional_ML/**: Linear regression and classic ML algorithms
- **01_Perceptrons_Rosenblatt/**: Perceptron algorithm and class
- **02_Scalar_Autograd/**: Micrograd autograd implementation
- **03_Scalar_MLP/**: Scalar MLP examples
- **04_Tensor_Class/**: Tensor class and related notebooks
- **05_Tensor_MLP/FCN/**: Fully connected network and housing dataset
- **06_CNN_Vectorised/**: CNN models, training, and notes
- **07_Transformers/**: Transformer models, tensor library, and handwritten notes
- **99_Deployment_Tests/**: Deployment scripts and tests

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pawan-Adhikari/ML-maths.git
   ```
3. Explore the notebooks and Python scripts in each module.

## Future Work
- Custom CUDA kernels
- Performance Optimisations
